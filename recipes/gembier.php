            <p class="brew-description">Sweet. Sour. Spicy. <i>Gembier</i> is a <i>Ginger Ale's</i> more interesting, alcoholic brother. <i>Gembier</i> is a very affordable and accessible brew, and makes for a great introduction to homebrewing. This naturally flavoured- and naturally carbonated brew only calls for five ingredients: <i>Ginger</i>, <i>Sugar</i>, <i>Lemon</i>, <i>Water</i>, and a wee bit of patience.</p>

            <h2>Here's how it's done.</h2>
            <div class="phase" id="preface">
              <h3 onclick="location.href='#preface'">Preface</h3>
              <p><i>Brewing</i> is a craft that revolves around on <i>Planning</i> and <i>Sanitation</i> &mdash; make sure you have all ingredients and equipment ready and sanitised: this will save you a lot of headaches later on.</p>
              <p>However, <i>Brewing</i> is also about <i>Experimentation</i> and <i>Enjoying Yourself</i>. As a wise man once said: <i class="quote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Papazian" target="_blank">Relax. Don't worry. And have a homebrew</a></i>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="phase" id="ginger-bug">
              <h3 onclick="location.href='#ginger-bug'">The Ginger Bug &mdash; [1/4]</h3>
              <p>Ginger has natural yeasts present on its skin &mdash; we'll be cultivating this into a <i>Ginger Bug</i> which we later use to bless ourselves with alcohol. This process will take us two to three days. Don't worry: it's hardly any work at all.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fill a mason jar with 500ml of room-temperature water, and add in 25 grams of granulated sugar.</li>
                <li>Use a grater or kitchen knife to couresly grate 25 grams of ginger. Remember to leave the skin on. Add the grated ginger to the mason jar, and use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir.</li>
                <li>Cover the mason jar with a cheese-cloth or a paper towel, and let the jar sit in room temperature for 24 hours.</li>
                <li>The next day, add an additional 25 grams of grated ginger and 25 grams of granulated sugar. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Keep repeating this until you see tiny bubbles appear in your liquid and it starts to smell of alcohol &mdash; this means your <i>Ginger Bug</i> is alive and ready for action!</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="phase" id="boil">
              <h3 onclick="location.href='#boil'">The Boil &mdash; [2/4]</h3>
              <p>During <i>The Boil</i> we prepare the <i>Wort</i> for <i>The Fermentation Phase</i> by making sure all fermentable materials are mixed well in our liquid.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Grab a pot that can hold at least <span class="amount">5</span> liters, and place it on your stove. Pour <span class="amount">3.8</span> liters of water in the pot, and turn on the stove.</li>
                <li>Add <span class="amount">500</span> grams of granulated sugar, and peel- and shred around <span class="amount">100</span> grams of ginger. Add these to the pot too.</li>
                <li>Bring the pot up to a rolling boil, then lower the temperature. Let the liquid simmer for <i>Five to Ten</i> minutes. Turn off the heat afterwards.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="phase" id="fermentation">
              <h3 onclick="location.href='#fermentation'">The Fermentation &mdash; [3/4]</h3>
              <p>During <i>The Fermentation</i> we use our own cultivated yeast <i>(Mr. Ginger Bug)</i> to turn the <i>Wort</i> into <i>Ginger Beer!</i> For this to happen, two things are crucial: <i>Sanitation</i> and <i>Temperature Control</i>.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make sure anything that (indirectly) touches the <i>Wort</i> from now on is <i>sanitised!</i></li>
                <li>Cool the <i>Wort</i> (in an ice bath, or using a <i>Wort Cooler</i>) until it reaches 21¬∞C.</li>
                <li>Use a <i>Racking Cane</i> to siphon your cooled-down <i>Wort</i> into your sanitised <i>Fermentation Vessel</i>.</li>
                <li>Filter out the particles in your <i>Ginger Bug</i> and add it to the <i>Fermentation Vessel</i>.</li>
                <li><i>Pitch</i> your <i>Yeast</i> (or <i>Yeast Starter</i> if you are fancy üé©).</li>
                <li><i>Aerate</i> (introduce oxygen) the <i>Wort</i> and <i>Yeast</i> by thoroughly shaking the <i>Fermentation Vessel</i> while closing the top.</li>
                <li>Sanitise- and assemble your screw-stop stopper with an airlock filled with sanitiser liquid. Store the fermenter in a dark place at room temperature.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Our final step in this journey. In the <i>Bottling</i> phase we &hellip; bottle our brew. For this step, make sure you have sanitised bottles, and a way to close them off (using bottle caps, or swing-top bottles).</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Take off the screw-top stopper from the fermentation vessel, and siphon your <i>(now alcoholic)</i> ginger beer into a sanitised bottling bucket.</li>
                <li>We want our brew to be properly carbonated. This can be done by adding some extra sugar <i>(Priming)</i>. Warning: do not overprime your beer, you'll end up with dangerous bottle bombs!</li>
                <li>As a rule of thumb, add <i>~7.90 g</i> of sugar per liter of homebrew. For this recipe, this means we add a total of <i><span class="amount">30</span> grams</i> of sugar to the bottling bucket.</li>
                <li>Allow the sugar to dissolve in the bottling bucket, and siphon your brew from the bucket into your bottles.</li>
                <li>Make sure the bottles are securely shut, and store them in a dark place for one to two weeks. Place them in the fridge the night before you want to enjoy them. Cheers! üçª</li>
