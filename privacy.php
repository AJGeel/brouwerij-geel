          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <h1>We care, and think you should too.</h1>
          <p>Far too often, we see modern websites <i>(looking at you, Facebook &amp; Google)</i> follow our every move, all just to push 'more relevant ads'. We don't like that. On this page we share what happens when you visit our page, and the measures we take to protect your data.</p>

        <p><i>Brouwerij Geel is a website created- and maintained by Arthur Geel.</i></p>

          What data do we collect?
        </h1>
        <p>Whenever you visit Brouwerij Geel, we collect anonymous logging data that your browser sends to us. For example, this allows us to understand which devices (phones, tablets, computers) were used to access this website, so we can make sure this website works well for these.</p>
        <p>Often, tools like <i>Google Analytics</i> are used for this. However, tools like these often share your browsing activities with companies like Google. We don't like that. We currently have a rudimentary custom-built logging system in place which does not share your browsing activity with anyone else. üéâ</p>
        <p class="side-note"><span>Side note:</span> in the future we may upgrade to a self-hosted variant of Matomo Analytics, a Google Analytics alternative which actually respects your privacy. This would allow us to better understand how you (anonymously) use this site, without us selling out your data.</p>

          How do Cookies fit into this?
        </h1>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are stored on your device's hard drive, and can be requested by the website to understand what should be returned to you.</p>
        <p>Brouwerij Geel's website uses these cookies to make parts of the web-site function, to better understand how this site is being used <i>(and how it should be designed)</i>, and to allow external services/libraries to function.</p>
        <p>The form below contains an overview of your current cookie settings, and what these imply for your privacy. You can easily change your settings by clicking on either option!</p>

          External Service Providers
        </h1>
        <p>The Brouwerij Geel website employs a number of third-party services for its functionalities. Here is a list of all third-parties, and how they may affect your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Disqus (Comment thread system)</b>. Integrating Disqus allowed us to easily allow my visitors to leave comments under the brewing recipe pages, and make spammer's lives tougher. However, Disqus do track non-personally identifiable information, and may even allow marketeers to tailor their ads using that information. <b>We recommend you opt-out of this</b>. You can do so <a class="link" href="https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/">by clicking this link</a>. You may also choose to out-right block Disqus from working on this website for you, click on 'Cookie Settings &mdash; I want... just the basics.' for that.</li>
          <li><i>Others will be listed here in the future too.</i></li>
