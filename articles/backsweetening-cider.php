        <article class="blog-article">
          <p class="dropcap">At Brouwerij Geel, we like to keep things simple. Our current brewing process is very bare-bones: the small batch-sizes (4L-20L) and quick turnaround time (&lt;1 month) allow us to skip a second fermentation, protecting the brews from unnecessary oxidation. Currently, we only bottle the final product &mdash; we don't keg yet. This means that in order to have a fizzy end-product, we need to ensure some yeast transfers into the bottle, along with some residual sugar. A small second fermentation takes place in the bottle, where the yeast converts residual sugars into a small amount of alcohol and CO<sub>2</sub>: <i>carbonation</i>!</p>

          <!-- <blockquote>A healthy sourdough starter means great bread.</blockquote> -->


          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>For most brewing styles <i>(semi-dry to dry ciders, any IPA or Ale)</i> this works really well. However, our current approach makes an end product with higher residual sugars difficult. Especially (semi)-sweet cider has been requested more than once.</p>
          <p>However, we cannot both have a sweet end-result and carbonation... <i>or can we?</i></p>
          <hr>
          <p>A potential approach to resolve this problem would be <a href="https://seedtopantryschool.com/should-you-pasteurize-hard-cider/" target="_blank">to pasteurise the brew</a> once enough of the sugars have been converted into CO<sub>2</sub>, killing the yeast and keeping some residual sugars. To do so, you can put cider bottles in a water bath of 85&deg;C for ten minutes, which ensures the yeast won't eat any remaining sugars.</p>
          <p>However, I find this approach risky: the carbonation would be imprecise, and if you'd forget to pasteurise the bottles, the yeast would turn the bottles into dangerous bottle bombs.</p>

          <h2>A Potential Alternative</h2>
          <p>The wonders of modern technology have given us alcohol-based sugar substitutes like erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol. An up-and-comer in this category is Stevia, a plant-based artificial sweetener which has <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008134420339" target="_blank">30 to 150 times the sweetness of sugar</a>.</p>
          <p>Now, sugar substitutes may be interesting due to their low calorie content, but their main appeal to me is their <a href="https://data.epo.org/gpi/EP3025594A1.pdf" target="_blank">non-fermentability</a>! This means that we get to have greater control over the final sweetness of the cider, whilst also retaining the ever-important carbonation.</p>

          <h2>The Master Plan</h2>
          <p>I currently have a new cider which has been sitting in primary fermentation for two weeks — nearly ready to be bottled.</p>
          <p>As a rule of thumb I prime my cider with <i>roughly 7 grams of fermentable sugar per liter</i> before bottling, which results in roughly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/carbonation" target="_blank">two to three volumes</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> in the final drink. </p>
          <p>In addition to that, I will be back-sweetening the </p>
          <p>Previously, I encouraged people to replace the beer on top of the yeast with pre-boiled and chilled water if they planned to store it for longer than a couple weeks. However, I’ve recently been made aware of some <a href="#!">fairly convincing evidence</a> suggesting this is both unnecessary and potentially harmful to the yeast. I started leaving the starter beer on top of the harvested cake and I’ve experienced no noticeably negative impact. For these reasons, I no longer plan to replace the beer with boiled water and recommend others follow suit.</p>
          <p>After some time in the fridge, a nice layer of creamy yeast will be sitting at the bottom of the jar.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <div class="faq outlined">
            <p>How many generations of yeast can be harvested before it goes bad?</p>
            <p>I’ve only anecdotal evidence, so keep that in mind. At the writing of this article, I have two strains of yeast, WLP090 San Diego Super Yeast and WLP002 English Ale Yeast, both have been harvested 13 times. The 12th beer each fermented tasted great with no noticeable differences compared to the original vial. I’ve used this method successfully with ale, hybrid, and lager strains.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq outlined">
            <p>What makes this method any better than rinsing (“washing”) yeast?</p>
            <p>To start with, I personally think it is much easier and far less time consuming. Additionally, the yeast fermented a wort of ~1.040 OG that had no hops in it, so it is arguably less stressed and ultimately cleaner. I also like that I’m only harvesting a single jar of yeast as opposed to multiple jars that would eventually end up in the trash.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq outlined">
            <p>How much yeast is actually being harvested using this method?</p>
            <p>I don’t know. I wish I knew, but I’ve yet to find anyone with the know-how to do an official count. As I mentioned before, I’ve been assuming 100 billion cells, though I fully accept this number is likely way off. Still, it has worked great for me.</p>
